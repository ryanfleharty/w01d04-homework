// PROBLEM SOLVING WITH FUNCTIONS

//1. VERBAL QUESTIONS

//1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument. 
//   Parameter is what you use as the placeholders for the data that will be input in
//   your function
//   Arguments are the data that is passed in to the function in place of the parameters

//2. Return gives you the output of a function. It does not print anything to the console
//   or inherently do anything until called. 

//   console.log() will log whatever is passed in to the console. It does not actually do anything
//   other than print to the console and its output cannot be assigned to a variable. 

//3. When you assign a function to a variable, you are then able to use the function
//   to do stuff. This allows you to use functions in other functions and in other 
//places around the page.
