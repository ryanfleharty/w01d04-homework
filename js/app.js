//Problem solving with Functions

//1. Verbal questions
//1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
//A perameter is the variable you put between the () within a function.
//ex. (num, str, arr)
//An argument is the value you put in the () when you call a function.
//ex. function(123); 

//2. Within a function, what is the difference between return and 
//console.log?
//Return actually outputs the value to the interface.
//console.log is a way to check and debug code only seen by programmers.

//3. What are the implications of the ability of a function to 
//return a value?
//return actually outputs the value so it can be stored as a variable 
//and used later. 


//2. Palindrome again.
//Write a function checkPalindrome that accepts a single argument, 
//a string. Yes, you've done it before, but do it again. Later in 
//this assignment we're gonna beef up our palindrome function some. 
//See if you can do it without looking back at your previous answer. 
//The function should return true if the string is a palindrome, 
//false if not. Make sure your function will give the correct 
//answer for words with capital letters.

const checkPalindrome = (str) => {
    let isItAPalindrome = str.split('').reverse().join('');
    if (str === isItAPalindrome) {
        return str + ' is a palindrome.';
    }
    else {
        return str + ' is NOT a palindrome.'
    }
  }

  console.log(checkPalindrome('madams'));



//3. Digit Sum
//Write a function sumDigits that accepts a number and returns the 
//sum of its digits.

//FIGURED THIS ONE OUT 

const sumDigits = (num) => {
    let x =  num;
    let sum = 0;
    let numbers = ("" + x).split("");
    for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++){
    sum += +numbers[i];
    }
    return sum;
 }

console.log(sumDigits(1223));



//4. Pythagoras
//Write a function calculateSide that takes two arguments: sideA 
//and sideB, and returns the solution for sideC using the 
//Pythagorean theorem.
//hint: discover the Pythagorean Theorem on a website called 
//google.com
//hint: checkout the Math methods in javascript
//a2 + b2 = c2

const calculateSide = (sideA, sideB) => {
    let sideC = (sideA * sideA) + (sideB * sideB);
    console.log(sideC);
    return sideC;
}

calculateSide(8, 6);



//5. Sum Array
//Write a function sumArray that takes an array as an argument. The array 
//should contain numbers. The function should return the sum of the numbers 
//in the array.
//Expected result: console.log(sumArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]));

// FIGURED THIS ONE OUT TOO

let total = 0;

const sumArray = (arr) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        total += arr[i];
        console.log(total);
    }
}

console.log(sumArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]));


//6. Prime Numbers
//A Prime number is a number that is not evenly divisible by 
//another number except 1 and itself. If you want to read more 
//deeply about it, go here. To test whether a number is Prime, 
//you only need to test as far as the square root of that number. 
//This is advisable for optimization and testing large numbers.

//Step One
//Write a function called checkPrime that will test whether a 
//number is Prime. The function will return true (Boolean) if 
//Prime, false if not. Hint: Check every number up to the square 
//root. To do this, try a for loop.

const checkPrime = (num) => {
    for (let i = 2; i < num; i++) {
        if (num % i === 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return num > 1;
}

console.log(checkPrime(7));
console.log(checkPrime(42));

//Step Two
//Write another function called printPrimes that will print 
//(console log) all the Primes up to an arbitrary limit. For 
//example, if you invoke your function with printPrimes(97), 
//it will print all the Prime numbers up to and including 97. 
//This function can call on the previous checkPrime function.

// FELT REALLY SILLY ONCE I WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT IT. I 
// FAILED TO REALIZE LAST WEEK THAT I SHOULD USE THE FUNCTION
// I JUST CREATED. HENCE PART 2.


//check for prime
//if prime, print
    
const printPrimes = (num) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < num; i++) {
        if (checkPrime(i) === true) {
            console.log(i)
        }
    }
}
printPrimes(21);
