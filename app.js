console.log("Homework page ready!")

//1. A parameter is a variable within a method definition.
// An argument is the value a parameter holds.

//2. A return will end a function and (sometimes) returns a value
// while a console.log doesn't interact with your code, it just
// will log a value into the browser console if it gets called.

//3. If a function returns a value, the user knows that the function
// has been completed.
